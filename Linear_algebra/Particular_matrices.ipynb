    "## 1. Inverse of triangular matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's denote $\\mathbb{L}_n$ and $\\mathbb{U}_n$ respectively the set of $n^{th}$ order lower invertible triangular matrices and $n^{th}$ order upper invertible triangular matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proposition 1.1\n",
    "$\\mathbb{L}_n$ and $\\mathbb{U}_n$ are groups associated to matrices multiplication.\n",
    "#### Proof\n",
    "We write the proof only for the lower case; the upper case is similar by replacing lower operations to upper operations.<br>\n",
    "Let $A, B \\in \\mathbb{L}_n$.<br> \n",
    "$$\n",
    "(AB)_{i,j} = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} A_{i,k} B_{k,j} \\\\\n",
    "(AB)_{i,j} = \\sum_{k=1}^{i} A_{i,k} B_{k,j}\n",
    "$$ <br>\n",
    "If $i \\leq j-1$ then $B_{k,j} = 0$ for all $k=1,..,i$ and $(AB)_{i,j}=0$.<br>\n",
    "That means $AB$ is lower trinagular.<br>\n",
    "We have $|AB| = |A||B|$ which is <strong>not null</strong>. <br>\n",
    "Then $AB \\in \\mathbb{L}_n$.<br>\n",
    "We will use Gaussian elimination to find the inverse of $A$: applying Gaussian eliminiation on $[ A | I_n]$ where $I_n$ is the $n^{th}$ order identity matrix.<br>\n",
    "While $A$ is lower triangular, we need only to eliminate elements under diagonal, at the right side of $[A|I_n]$, only the elements under diagonal will be changed and the rest still $0$.<br>\n",
    "The at the end, we will obtain again a lower triangular matrix, that means $A^{-1}$ is lower triangular.<br>\n",
    "We have $|A^{-1}| = \\frac{1}{|A|}$ which is <strong>not null</strong>, then $A^{-1} \\in \\mathbb{L}_n$.<br>\n",
    "We conclude that $\\mathbb{L}_n$ is a sub-group of $\\mathbb{GL}_n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Property\n",
    "The inverse of an invertible triangular matrix is also triangular of the same form.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proposition 1.2\n",
    "Let \n",
